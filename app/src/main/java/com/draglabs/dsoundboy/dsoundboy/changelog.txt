v1.17.08.14
    -
v1.17.08.15
    - added logos
        - when pressed on MainActivity, open http://draglabs.com in browser
    - added Chronometer to measure recording time
        - start/stop button to start/stop time, clear resets it
        - counter of clicks allows Chronometer to resume
    - red record button shows up when the app is recording and goes away when it isn't and when it's been reset
    - added activity to add recording info for the band
        - needs to better save and transfer data to the parent activity
v1.17.08.16
    - finally added to github
        - git@github.com:draglabs/dSoundBoy-Android-V2.git
    - finally fixed sending values from EnterInfo to MainActivity
        - When clicking "Save" in EnterInfo, launches new Intent which goes to MainActivity
            - MainActivity re-launches, and gets its launching intent which is EnterInfo
            - Once started recording, unless it happens in the background, if go to EnterInfo, then recording will stop
                - Solution is to disable the start/stop and reset buttons until band info has been entered, and then disable the enter info button
                    - However any attributes won't be saved between these two so there has to be a values file that is edited with a boolean flag
                        - Set "enterInfoClicked" to false at start --> clickEnterInfo - enable Start/Stop and Reset, set "enterInfoClicked" to true, disable EnterInfo button
                        - Need three flags: submit, start/stop, reset
                            - Stored in strings.xml
v1.17.08.23
    - fixing various issues
        - intent hopefully passes info
        - sharedpreferences doesn't really work because it doesn't save the info, and I can't figure it out why even though I'm following all the guides
            - two ideas:
                - have an integer that counts how many times the MainActivity has been loaded, if it's odd then the buttons are enabled, and vice-versa
                - store enabled/disabled booleans and keep those to say which buttons are enabled and which are disabled
    - added LoginActivity that will later implement Facebook authentication
    - will add recording capabilities, maybe in FileUtils.java, or in a recorderUtils class
        - hopefully it won't require weird or special inheritance stuff
        - Recorder.java
            - instantiate the class
            - RequestPermission() is giving trouble because it needs to access an Activity and it's not taking MainActivity.this in
    - review button statuses ***
V1.17.08.25
    - turns out that you can't pause and resume recordings, you can only start and stop them
        - so then I'll have to re-implement the start/stop functionality
            - maybe join the recordings? or just submit all of them with original start times
    - kinda records, saves on phone, haven't tested recording yet, large file size
    - continue to review button statuses and activity switches
    - emulator doesn't run, but adb to phone works
    - adding AWS capabilities
        - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/setup.html
        - cognito
        - Facebook Federated Authentication: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/facebook.html
v1.17.08.29
    - fucking manifest mergers not working
        - fixed by deleting all "replace"s?
    - annoying Facebook API that isn't compatible with 26.0.1 but only works with 25.3.1 which can't be found
        - was fixed? ./gradlew -q dependencies app:dependencies --configuration compile
    - adding and improving Facebook authentication features
        - adding button into LoginActivity, and a TextView that shows the login results
        - doesn't work yet
        - read to do in LoginActivity
v1.17.08.30
    - Facebook authentication works
    - next: make LoginActivity the default activity
        - clicking "Continue" in LoginActivity takes to MainActivity
            - on getIntent(), check calling/upper class
                - if it's LoginActivity, then turn recording button off and enter info buttons on
                - if it's EnterInfo, then turn recording button on and login button off
    - detail: start recording timer only when it's enabled, not when app is opened
    - important to clean code
    - instead of with SharedPreferences, send data with Extras via Intents !*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!
        - button flow:
            - login --> enter info --> start/stop --> submit
                - don't want to have to log in on app open if already logged in
    - future for implementation:
        - get Facebook ID and integrate with recordings
        - make sure recording works well
            - file formats, sizes, locations, names, etc
        - upload to S3
        - download/view/share recordings
        - send support emails

    - next is to make sure recordings get saved into the correct folder and are playable
        - added screen to show recordings
            - needs button to play recordings

v1.17.09.08
    - added Create and Join Jam buttons
        - functionality not yet implemented, shows Snackbar
        - check button layouts on activity, seem off, can't figure out why constraints there are wonky
    - recording note:
        - no start/pause recording, only start and submit (upload) when buttons are pressed, maybe reset though
        - name recording after Facebook ID
            - two userModel IDs? one from Shyam and one from Facebook?
    - add documentation/instructions screen for app?
    - fix playing recordings and buttons therein in ListOfRecordings
    - finished Cognito sync, and can get all credentials now, have yet to test
        - rather than have the AWSutils initializer in LoginActivity, have it in the recorderUtils while submit?

    - need to authenticate userModel with Shyam, and do other things with API
